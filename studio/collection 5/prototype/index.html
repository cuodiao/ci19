							<p class="white">Xiangqi also called Chinese chess, is a strategy board game for two players. The game represents a battle between two armies, with the object of capturing the enemy's general (king). Distinctive features of xiangqi include the cannon (pao), which must jump to capture; a rule prohibiting the generals from facing each other directly; areas on the board called the river and palace, which restrict the movement of some pieces (but enhance that of others); and placement of the pieces on the intersections of the board lines, rather than within the squares.</p>

							<p class="white">The Lantern Festival is the colourful big finish to the Lunar New Year celebration. This is when kids get to shine — by carrying lanterns and by showing off your brain power by solving the riddles inside the lanterns.In ancient times, advisors to the emperor who had suggestions they thought wouldn’t go over very well gave them in vague riddles. So if the emperor hated the advice, they could say they meant something completely different! </p>

							<h1>500B.C.</h1>
							<p class="white">Mahjong (/mɑːˈdʒɒŋ/ mah-JONG, Mandarin: [mǎ.tɕjâŋ]) is a tile-based game that was developed in China. It is commonly played by four players (with some three-player variations found in Japan, South Korea and Southeast Asia). The game and its regional variants are widely played throughout Eastern and South Eastern Asia and have become popular in Western countries too. The game has also been adapted into a widespread online entertainment.[1][2][3][4] Similar to the Western card game rummy, Mahjong is a game of skill, strategy, and calculation and involves a degree of chance.</p>

							<h1>105A.D.</h1>
							<p class="white">Paper was first invented in China around 105 A.D., and was brought to Japan by monks in the sixth century. Handmade paper was a luxury item only available to a few, and paper folding in ancient Japan was strictly for ceremonial purposes, often religious in nature.By the Edo period, paper folding in Japan had become recreational as well as ceremonial, often featuring multiple cuts and folds.</p>
